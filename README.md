Overview
-------------------------------------
The point of the game is to get the star to the "StarGate" by pulling back and shooting it (pulling back on the star and letting it go).

There are 3 Parts to this game.  

**MainMenu**  
This is the basic intro to the game

**Levels**

SetUp and GlobalObjects 
-------------------------------------
**SetUp.cs**  
The SetUp.cs script creates 4 objects, if they don't already exists. These 4 Objects will not be destroied (see DontDestroy.cs) and will last the entirety of the game...hence GlobalObjects.

Audio System
-------------------------------------
**MusicManager && SoundManager**  
These two gameobjects are created at the start of the game to play the music and any sound we would like to be played. Since these objects are not destroied during the scene change there is no stop in the music or the sound.

Please see the following scripts for more information:  
MusicManager.cs  
SoundManager.cs  
VolumeControl.cs  
PlaySound.cs  


Scene Transition System 
-------------------------------------
**SceneSwitchAnimator**  
This gameObject is used to switch the scenes in an elegant and easy way. 

 
~~~cs
//displays animation than switch scene...
SceneSwitchAnimator.Instance.ChangeScene(SceneName,gameObject.transform.position);

//Note: The position passed into the method is where the transition will start. 
~~~



LevelMenu 
-------------------------------------
The LevelMenu is it's own asset and it's documentation can be found in Assets/ShootingStar/LevelMenu/. 



GameManager
-------------------------------------
The **GameManager.cs** is the main piece of each level that controls The Level's State (StartGame, Play, Win, Reset, and Pause). The GameManger.cs will also interact with the AnimUI (the object that shows/hides menus), the DTTR (double tap to reset), and the PauseButton. 

The GameManager.cs and all the other scripts are commented in detail, but please reach out to me if you have any questions.
